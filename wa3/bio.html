      <article>
        <p>I am studying at CU Boulder in the Creative Technology and Design school. I am focusing on product development within this major.
            And completing a business minor with an entrepreneurship focus.</p>
        <p>Skills I hold are spread a bit thin.</p>
        <h3L>To create a product and sell it, I have had brief interactions with...</h3L> 
        <ul>
            <li>Some of the design process</li>
            <p>- Designing a manual mirror pivot assembly</p>
            <li>User interface cohesion</li>
            <p>- Mirror needs to hold it's position over bumps and vibration, and be adjustable by hand.</p>
            <li>Manufacturing methods and materials</li>
            <p>- Vaccum infused and wet layup carbon fiber shells from two piece molds, Plasma cut stainless brackets and baseplates. Welded threaded studs on baseplate. White silicone caulk to hold mirror.</p>
            <li>Sorting a supply chain</li>
            <p>2 different carbon manufacturing facilities, send cut send for brackets and baseplates, been through chinese, european, and domestic hardware suppliers (chinese quality and lead times ftw)</p>
            <li>Quality Control</li>
            <p>Carbon molds from first manufactuerer were warped from heat in epoxy cure process. Wet layup process was leading to bubbling and imperfect surface. Discovered after 5 pairs were pulled from mold and already took 3 orders.</p>

        <h2>Passions</h2>
        <article>When I am not stressing about orders and manufacturing lead times. I am out downhill mountain biking and skiing all around Colorado and sometimes Canada. I love airtime, technicality, style, and speed. I also own and modify 2 turbo subarus. I hunt down rare aftermarket subaru parts, and collect archival vintage/Y2K clothing pieces from different subcultures I love. I go home frequently to visit my 4 cute cats. </article>
