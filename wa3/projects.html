        <p>Pictured above is the second iteration of molds for carbon mirror shells. Fiberglass is an option too.</p>
        <p>I am 2 years into this project. A full redesign on the manual pivot assembly, upgraded shell material, wide angle glass with branding. And multiple orders.</p>

      <h2>Project: Custom Fog light Brackets</h2>

        <p>
            Pictured above is my car, fitted with large diameter HELLA fog lights.
            To achieve this factory look rally style, I fabricated adjustable brackets,
            mounting them directly to the bumper beam.
            Then cut bolt holes and clearanced the custom fiberglass bumper to tuck these.

        The image also shows a prototype pair of my side mirrors in use.
