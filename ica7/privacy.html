  <h2>Privacy Statement — Subaru Reproduction Part Requests</h2>
  <p>
    We collect only the part request details you enter (your name, vehicle model, and optional notes) 
    and store them locally in your browser’s <code>localStorage</code>. 
    This information is used solely to display your current part requests on this site and 
    to preserve your entries between visits. 
    <strong>No data is sent to any external server</strong>.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Data is stored only on this device and will automatically expire after 30 days unless you clear it earlier.  
    You may opt out at any time using the “Opt out” checkbox; enabling opt-out prevents new data from being saved 
    and clears any existing requests.  
    The “Clear my stored data” button immediately removes your saved entries.  
    If you choose to export requests, a downloadable JSON file is created and saved to your device only.
